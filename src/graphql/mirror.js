/**
 * Execute a function inside a database transaction.
 *
 * The database must not be in a transaction. A new transaction will be
 * entered, and then the callback will be invoked.
 *
 * If the callback completes normally, then its return value is passed
 * up to the caller, and the currently active transaction (if any) is
 * committed.
 *
 * If the callback throws an error, then the error is propagated to the
 * caller, and the currently active transaction (if any) is rolled back.
 *
 * Note that the callback may choose to commit or roll back the
 * transaction before returning or throwing an error. Conversely, note
 * that if the callback commits the transaction, and then begins a new
 * transaction but does not end it, then this function will commit the
 * new transaction if the callback returns (or roll it back if it
 * throws).
